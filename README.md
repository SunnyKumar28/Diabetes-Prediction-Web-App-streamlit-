Diabetes Prediction Web App
This web application predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on several health metrics. It uses a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) machine learning model trained on a dataset with relevant features.

Features
The prediction is based on the following features:

Number of Pregnancies: The number of times the patient has been pregnant.
Glucose Level: Plasma glucose concentration a few hours after a meal.
Blood Pressure Value: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
Insulin Level: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI Value: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age: The age of the patient.
How to Use
Go to the Diabetes Prediction Web App.
Enter the required values for each feature in the provided input fields.
Click on the Predict button.
The app will display the prediction result indicating whether the patient is likely to have diabetes or not.
Technical Details
Model: The prediction is made using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model.
Framework: The web app is built using Streamlit, an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
